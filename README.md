# Project name
This a classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe game created by using Python’s Tkinter library.

## Features
- Automatic Scorekeeping: Displays the score for each player (number of wins) and updates it after each game.
- Game Restart Option: Implemented a "New Game" button that clears the board while keeping the current score.
- Simple UI Enhancements: Used colors, font styles, and Tkinter layout options to improve the game’s visual appeal.
- Single Player Mode with AI: Allows the user to choose between playing against another person or an AI opponent. Implemented basic AI using random moves or a more advanced strategy such as the minimax algorithm.
- Improved UX/UI: Created a dynamic interface that offers options for player vs. player or player vs. AI, and provides a menu or settings panel.
- Animations and Effects: Added subtle animations (e.g., highlight winning cells) and sound effects to enhance the experience.
